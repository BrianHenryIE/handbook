# wp scaffold package-readme

Generate a README.md for your command.

This command runs on the `before_wp_load` hook, just before the WP load process begins.

Creates a README.md with Using, Installing, and Contributing instructions based on the composer.json file for your WP-CLI package. Run this command at the beginning of your project, and then every time your usage docs change.

These command-specific docs are generated based composer.json -&gt; 'extra'
-&gt; 'commands'. For instance, this package's composer.json includes:

```
{
  "name": "wp-cli/scaffold-package-command",
   // [...]
   "extra": {
       "commands": [
           "scaffold package",
           "scaffold package-tests",
           "scaffold package-readme"
       ]
   }
}
```

You can also customize the rendering of README.md generally with composer.json -&gt; 'extra' -&gt; 'readme'. For example, runcommand/hook's composer.json includes:

```
{
    "extra": {
        "commands": [
            "hook"
        ],
        "readme": {
            "shields": [
                "[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/runcommand/reset-password.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/runcommand/reset-password)"
            ],
            "sections": [
                "Using",
                "Installing",
                "Support"
            ],
            "support": {
                "body": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runcommand/runcommand-theme/master/bin/readme-partials/support-open-source.md"
            },
            "show_powered_by": false
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:

* "shields" supports arbitrary images as shields to display.
* "sections" permits defining arbitrary sections (instead of default Using, Installing and Contributing).
* "support" -&gt; "body" uses a remote Markdown file as the section contents. This can also be a local file path, or a string.
* "show_powered_by" shows or hides the Powered By mention at the end of the readme.

For sections, "pre", "body" and "post" are supported. Example:
```
"support": {
  "pre": "highlight.md",
  "body": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runcommand/runcommand-theme/master/bin/readme-partials/support-open-source.md",
  "post": "This is additional text to show after main body content."
},
``` In this example:

* "pre" content is pulled from local highlight.md file.
* "body" content is pulled from remote URL.
* "post" is a string.
